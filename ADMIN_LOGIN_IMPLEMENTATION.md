# Admin Login Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a dedicated admin login page for the Food Court Management System. This implementation includes:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dedicated Admin Login Page
- Separate login route at `/admin/login`
- Form validation for email and password
- Role-based access control (only FoodCourtOwner role allowed)
- Clear error messaging for authentication failures
- Redirect to admin dashboard upon successful authentication

### 2. Authentication Flow
- User enters admin credentials
- System validates credentials via API
- Checks user role to ensure they are an admin (FoodCourtOwner)
- Stores authentication token in localStorage
- Redirects to admin dashboard on success
- Shows appropriate error messages on failure

### 3. Security Features
- Role-based access control
- Token-based authentication
- Proper error handling
- Secure storage of authentication token

### 4. User Experience
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Responsive design
- Clear navigation between admin and regular user login
- Loading states during authentication
- Helpful error messages

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/frontend/src/components/auth/AdminLogin.js` - Dedicated admin login component

### Modified Files
1. `/frontend/src/App.js` - Added route for admin login
2. `/frontend/src/components/auth/auth.css` - Added styles for admin login
3. `/frontend/src/components/dashboard/AdminDashboard.js` - Enhanced authentication check

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend
- React component with hooks for state management
- Integration with existing API services
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design using CSS
- Role-based access control

### Backend Integration
- Utilizes existing authAPI for authentication
- Verifies user role after successful login
- Uses same token-based authentication as regular login

### Security
- Protected routes requiring admin authentication
- Role verification to ensure only admins can access
- Secure token storage in localStorage

## How to Access

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Enter admin credentials (user must have FoodCourtOwner role)
3. Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
4. Use the logout button in the sidebar to end the session

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Successful admin login flow
- Role verification (only FoodCourtOwner can access)
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Navigation between admin and regular user login
- Responsive design on different screen sizes

## Notes
- The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and conventions
- All components are modular and can be extended
- Error handling is implemented throughout
- The UI is user-friendly and intuitive
- Follows the same authentication pattern as the regular user login
