# Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
User was experiencing "Network error. Please try again" when attempting to log in to the admin dashboard.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incorrect API Response Handling**: AdminLogin component was trying to access `response.data.user?.role` but the actual API response structure has the role directly in `response.data.role`.
2. **Rate Limiting**: The authentication endpoint had strict rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes) which was exceeded during testing.
3. **User Verification Status**: The admin user account was not verified, which could cause login issues.
4. **Password Hashing Issues**: Manual password hashing in scripts was not consistent with the automatic hashing performed by the User model.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed AdminLogin Component
Updated the AdminLogin.js component to correctly access the user role from the API response:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const userRole = response.data.user?.role;

// After (correct):
const userRole = response.data.role;
```

### 2. Reset Rate Limiter
Restarted the backend server to reset the rate limiting counters.

### 3. Verified Admin User
Created a script to verify the admin user account:
```javascript
adminUser.isVerified = true;
adminUser.verificationToken = undefined;
await adminUser.save();
```

### 4. Fixed Password Hashing
Created a corrected script that allows the User model to automatically hash the password:
```javascript
// Create new admin user (password will be automatically hashed by the model)
const newUser = new User({
  name: 'Admin User',
  email: 'admin@example.com',
  password: 'admin123', // This will be automatically hashed
  role: 'FoodCourtOwner',
  isVerified: true
});

await newUser.save();
```

## Testing
After applying all fixes, the admin login is now working correctly:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: admin123

## Additional Scripts Created
1. `check_admin.js` - Check for existing admin users
2. `create_admin.js` - Create default admin user
3. `reset_admin_password.js` - Reset admin password
4. `check_user_details.js` - Check user details including password hash
5. `verify_admin_user.js` - Verify admin user account
6. `test_password.js` - Test password comparison
7. `create_new_admin.js` - Create new admin user (incorrect approach)
8. `create_correct_admin.js` - Create new admin user (correct approach)

## Prevention for Future Issues
1. Always restart servers after making code changes
2. Be aware of rate limiting during development/testing
3. Use the correct API response structure when accessing data
4. Allow Mongoose models to handle password hashing automatically
5. Verify user accounts when needed for testing

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/auth/AdminLogin.js` - Fixed API response handling
- Multiple scripts in `/backend/` directory for user management and testing

## Servers Status
Both servers are now running correctly:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5001
