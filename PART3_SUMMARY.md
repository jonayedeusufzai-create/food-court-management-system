# Part 3: Order Processing and Cart System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Part 3 of the Food Court Management System, which focuses on the Order Processing and Cart System. This part enables customers to add items from multiple stalls to their cart, proceed through checkout, place orders, and track their order status in real-time.

## Backend Implementation

### Models Created
1. **Cart Model** (`backend/models/Cart.js`)
   - Stores customer cart information
   - References to User model
   - Array of items with quantity and price
   - Total amount calculation

2. **Order Model** (`backend/models/Order.js`)
   - Complete order information storage
   - References to User and Stall models
   - Items array with detailed information
   - Status tracking (Pending, Preparing, Ready, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled)
   - Delivery address and payment details

3. **Payment Model** (`backend/models/Payment.js`)
   - Payment information storage
   - References to Order model
   - Payment method and status tracking
   - Transaction details

### Controllers Implemented
1. **Cart Controller** (`backend/controllers/cartController.js`)
   - `getCart` - Retrieve customer's cart
   - `addToCart` - Add items to cart
   - `updateCartItem` - Update item quantities
   - `removeFromCart` - Remove items from cart
   - `clearCart` - Clear entire cart

2. **Order Controller** (`backend/controllers/orderController.js`)
   - `getOrders` - Get all orders (admin)
   - `getOrderById` - Get specific order details
   - `getMyOrders` - Get orders for current user
   - `getOrdersByStall` - Get orders for a specific stall
   - `createOrder` - Create new order from cart
   - `updateOrderStatus` - Update order status

3. **Payment Controller** (`backend/controllers/paymentController.js`)
   - `processPayment` - Process payment for an order
   - `getPaymentByOrder` - Get payment details by order ID
   - `getPaymentById` - Get specific payment details

### Routes Created
1. **Cart Routes** (`backend/routes/cartRoutes.js`)
   - `GET /api/cart` - Get cart
   - `POST /api/cart` - Add to cart
   - `PUT /api/cart/:itemId` - Update cart item
   - `DELETE /api/cart/:itemId` - Remove from cart
   - `DELETE /api/cart` - Clear cart

2. **Order Routes** (`backend/routes/orderRoutes.js`)
   - `GET /api/orders` - Get all orders
   - `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get order by ID
   - `GET /api/orders/myorders` - Get current user's orders
   - `GET /api/orders/stall/:stallId` - Get orders by stall
   - `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
   - `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` - Update order status

3. **Payment Routes** (`backend/routes/paymentRoutes.js`)
   - `POST /api/payments` - Process payment
   - `GET /api/payments/order/:orderId` - Get payment by order
   - `GET /api/payments/:id` - Get payment by ID

### Server Integration
- Updated `backend/server.js` to include new routes
- Ensured proper middleware integration for authentication and error handling

## Frontend Implementation

### Components Created
1. **Cart Page** (`frontend/src/components/cart/CartPage.js`)
   - Displays items in cart
   - Allows quantity adjustment
   - Provides remove item functionality
   - Shows total amount
   - Links to checkout process

2. **Checkout Page** (`frontend/src/components/cart/CheckoutPage.js`)
   - Collects customer delivery information
   - Provides payment method selection
   - Displays order summary
   - Processes order placement

3. **Orders Page** (`frontend/src/components/orders/OrdersPage.js`)
   - Lists customer's order history
   - Shows order status and details
   - Provides links to order details

4. **Order Details Page** (`frontend/src/components/orders/OrderDetailsPage.js`)
   - Shows detailed information for a specific order
   - Displays items, delivery address, and payment information
   - Shows order status timeline

5. **Order Management** (`frontend/src/components/orders/OrderManagement.js`)
   - Stall owner interface for managing orders
   - Filter orders by status
   - Update order status (Preparing, Ready, Delivered)
   - View order details and items

### Styling
1. **Cart CSS** (`frontend/src/components/cart/cart.css`)
   - Styling for cart and checkout components
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **Orders CSS** (`frontend/src/components/orders/orders.css`)
   - Styling for order listing and details components
   - Status-specific styling for order states

### Routing
- Updated `frontend/src/App.js` to include routes for all new components
- Implemented role-based access control for order management
