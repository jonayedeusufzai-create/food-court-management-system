# Network Issue Resolution

## Problem
The food court login was showing a "network error check connection" message.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by rate limiting on the backend server. The rate limiter had been triggered due to too many requests, causing all subsequent requests to be blocked with a "429 Too Many Requests" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restarted Backend Server
- Stopped the existing backend process
- Started a fresh instance of the backend server
- This reset the rate limiter counters

### 2. Modified Rate Limiter Configuration
Updated `/Users/jonayedeusufzai2002/food_court_management/backend/server.js` to:

- Increase the rate limiter points from 10 to 100 per second
- Skip rate limiting entirely when NODE_ENV is set to "development"
- This prevents the aggressive rate limiting that was causing the network errors

### 3. Verified Connectivity
- Confirmed frontend is running on port 3000
- Confirmed backend is running on port 5001
- Tested API endpoints and confirmed they're responding correctly
- Verified CORS configuration is working properly

## Verification Steps
1. Backend server is running on port 5001
2. Frontend server is running on port 3000
3. API endpoints are accessible
4. CORS is properly configured
5. Rate limiting is appropriately configured for development
6. **User registration works correctly**
7. **User login works correctly**
8. **Authenticated API endpoints are accessible with JWT tokens**

## Test Credentials
- Email: customer@test.com
- Password: password123

## Prevention
- The NODE_ENV=development setting in the backend .env file ensures rate limiting is disabled during development
- Future deployments to production should review rate limiting settings to ensure they're appropriate for the production environment
- Consider implementing more specific rate limiting for different types of requests rather than a global rate limiter
