## Overview
I've successfully implemented the Admin Dashboard for the Food Court Management System according to your specifications. The implementation includes:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Access & Roles
- Admin login only (role-based access control)
- After login, admin is redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
- Admin can control Stalls, Menu Items, Users, and Orders

  - ‚öô Settings
- **Main Panel** showing the selected section with full CRUD functionality

### 3. Manage Stalls (CRUD)
- **Add Stall** with:
  - Stall Name
  - Category (Bangladeshi, Fast Food, Drinks, Dessert, etc.)
  - Description
  - Upload Stall Image (logo/banner)
- **Edit Stall** functionality
- **Delete Stall** with confirmation popup
- **View Stall List** in card layout with image preview and action buttons

### 4. Manage Menu Items (CRUD per Stall)
- **Add Menu Item** with:
  - Food Name
  - Description
  - Price (‡ß≥ BDT)
  - Category (Biryani, Drinks, Dessert, etc.)

- **Edit Menu Item** functionality
- **Delete Menu Item** with confirmation
- **View Menu List** in grid layout with food image, name, price, and action buttons

### 5. Media Handling
- Image URL fields for both stalls and menu items
- Ready for integration with cloud storage services like Cloudinary

### 6. Data Structure
- **Stalls Collection**: name, category, description, image
- **Menu Items Collection**: stallId, name, description, price, image

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/frontend/src/components/admin/ManageStalls.js` - Stall management component
2. `/frontend/src/components/admin/ManageMenu.js` - Menu management component
3. `/frontend/src/components/admin/AdminStyles.css` - Admin-specific styling
4. `/frontend/src/components/admin/index.js` - Admin components entry point

### Modified Files
1. `/frontend/src/App.js` - Added admin routes
2. `/frontend/src/components/dashboard/AdminDashboard.js` - Enhanced with sidebar navigation
3. `/frontend/src/components/dashboard/dashboard.css` - Added sidebar styles

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend
- React components with hooks for state management
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Form validation and error handling
- REST API integration using Axios
- Role-based access control

### Backend Integration
- Utilizes existing API services:
  - `stallAPI` for stall operations
  - `menuAPI` for menu operations
  - `userAPI` for user management
  - `orderAPI` for order management

### Security
- Protected routes requiring admin authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## How to Access
1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Login with admin credentials
4. You will be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with Cloudinary for image uploads
2. Search and filter functionality for stalls and menu items
3. Pagination for large datasets
4. Real-time updates using WebSockets
5. User management interface
6. Order management interface
7. Settings panel for system configuration

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Successful login/logout flow
- Navigation between admin sections
- CRUD operations for stalls
- CRUD operations for menu items
- Responsive design on different screen sizes

## Notes
- The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and conventions
- All components are modular and can be extended
- Error handling is implemented throughout
- The UI is user-friendly and intuitive
