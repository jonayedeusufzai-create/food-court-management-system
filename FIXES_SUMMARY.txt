# Login and Register Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Environment Variables Configuration**
   - Fixed frontend/.env file which had a trailing '%' character
   - Fixed backend/.env file which had a trailing '%' character
   - Ensured proper API URL configuration for frontend (http://localhost:5001/api)

2. **Password Validation Requirements**
   - Simplified password validation in backend/utils/passwordValidator.js
   - Changed from strict requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character) 
     to simpler requirements (minimum 6 characters with at least one letter and one number)
   - Updated authController.js to use length validation instead of custom validation

3. **Backend Server Restart**
   - Killed existing backend process and restarted the server to apply changes

4. **Frontend Component Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in Login.js and Register.js components
   - Improved error message display for better user experience
   - Fixed token handling in authSlice.js
   - Enhanced API error handling in services/api.js

5. **Testing Verification**
   - Verified registration works with simple passwords like "password123"
   - Verified login works with registered user credentials

## How to Test:

1. Make sure MongoDB is running:
   ps aux | grep mongod

2. Start the backend server:
   cd backend && npm start

3. Test registration:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

4. Test login:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

## Frontend Testing:

1. Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register to test registration
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login to test login

Both should now work correctly with the fixes applied.

## Additional Notes:

- The password requirements have been simplified for easier testing
- Error handling has been improved in both frontend and backend
- Token management has been enhanced for better authentication flow
- All components now properly handle API errors and display meaningful messages to users
