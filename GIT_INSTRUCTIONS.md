# Git Setup and Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push this project to your Git repository:

## Step 1: Add Remote Origin
Replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL` with your actual repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`)

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
```

## Step 2: Push to Remote Repository
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you want to push to a different branch
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## If you need to create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Don't initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license
3. Copy the repository URL
4. Follow the steps above

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error about the branch not existing remotely, try:
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

If you need to force push (only if you're sure it's safe to do so):
```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

Note: Only use --force if you're certain no one else is working on the repository.
